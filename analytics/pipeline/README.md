# Starknet Gaming — Analytics

The analytics wing of [starknet-gaming.com](https://starknet-gaming.com/), built to sit at
`/analytics`. It reuses the parent site's tokens — `#11100d` background, `#9d4dff` purple,
dark-only — so it reads as part of the same site, not a separate product.

The homepage is deliberately simple: **Players this week**, **Games tracked**, **Trending
genre**, one chart, one leaderboard. No token amounts up front. Click into any game, or the
Analytics tab, for volume, transactions, and full history — that depth is still there, just
one click deeper instead of on the first screen.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The whole dashboard. Self-contained, no build step, no dependencies. Drop at `/analytics/index.html`. |
| `schema.sql` | Base Supabase/Postgres schema. Run once, first. |
| `migration-002-multicontract.sql` | Adds support for games with several contracts (most real games have more than one). Run once, right after `schema.sql`. |
| `registry-seed-final.sql` | The 10 real games from starknet-gaming.com's own registry, with their actual mainnet contracts. Run once, after the migration. |
| `pull-lib.mjs` | Shared logic — Starkscan client, Supabase client, and `pullPeriod()`, the routine that turns one Monday-to-Sunday period into upserted rows. Both scripts below call this; neither talks to Starkscan/Supabase directly. |
| `weekly-pull.mjs` | Thin CLI: pulls real onchain numbers from Starkscan (falls back to Voyager) for one period. Runs **weekly** — see below. |
| `backfill.mjs` | One-off, run-it-yourself script. Walks a set of games back to their real first on-chain activity and fills in every period since, using the same `pullPeriod()` as the scheduled job. See the comment block at the top of the file for how it finds "launch" without guessing, and which games are excluded by default. |
| `.github/workflows/pull.yml` | Runs `weekly-pull.mjs` automatically once a week via GitHub Actions, right after each period closes. Free, no server needed. |
| `sg-track.js` | The embeddable snippet builders can add to their game's website, plus the receiving endpoint (commented at the bottom). Optional — only needed for the Retention page. |
| `discover.mjs` | The script that found the registry in the first place. Re-run it later to find newly-launched games. |
| `manual-tracking-notes.md` | The games on starknet-gaming.com that need manual follow-up (no public contract data found yet), grouped by how much effort each needs. |

## Going live — in order

1. **Database.** In the Supabase SQL editor, run in this exact order:
   `schema.sql` → `migration-002-multicontract.sql` → `registry-seed-final.sql`.
2. **Connect the frontend.** Already done if you're using the version from this zip — the
   `CONFIG` block near the top of `index.html`'s `<script>` has the Supabase URL and anon key
   filled in. (The anon key is safe here: RLS grants public `select` on four display tables
   only. Raw session events are never readable from the browser.)
3. **Get the pull job running weekly.**
   - Push this whole folder to a GitHub repo.
   - Repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add: `SUPABASE_URL`,
     `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (the *service_role* key — different from the anon key, and never
     put this one in `index.html`), `STARKSCAN_API_KEY`. `VOYAGER_API_KEY` is optional.
   - Repo → **Actions** tab → run "Weekly onchain data pull" once by hand to confirm it works.
     After that it runs itself every Monday at 03:10 UTC.
4. **Backfill history**, once — run `node backfill.mjs` locally (see the comment block at the
   top of that file). It's a manual, one-off job, not wired into the Action.
5. **Host the tracking snippet**, only if/when you want the Retention page populated — serve
   `sg-track.js` from `starknet-gaming.com/sg-track.js` and deploy the endpoint block
   commented at the bottom of that file to `/api/track`.

## How the pull works

`weekly-pull.mjs` runs once a week, right after a period closes, and finalizes that period —
`node weekly-pull.mjs` with no argument pulls the current period to-date; the scheduled Action
always passes the just-closed Monday explicitly so what lands is a finished period, not a
partial one. A specific period can still be pulled or refreshed by hand:
`node weekly-pull.mjs 2026-09-07`. `backfill.mjs` uses the same underlying routine
(`pullPeriod()` in `pull-lib.mjs`) in a loop over history instead of once for "now" — see that
file's own header for how it finds each game's real launch date and which games it skips by
default.

The dashboard's own copy never says "week" or "daily" anywhere — periods are just "updates" to
anyone reading the site. The Monday-to-Sunday boundary is an internal implementation detail
(and is disclosed honestly on the About page), not something the UI narrates.

## Adding a game

One row, no code:

```sql
insert into games (name, slug, category, url, category_confirmed) values
  ('Loot Survivor', 'loot-survivor', 'Roguelike / Dungeon', 'https://www.deathmountain.gg/', true);

insert into game_contracts (game_slug, address, label, counts_toward_activity) values
  ('loot-survivor', '0x0181…4dc4', 'Combat contract', true);
```

The registry page, detail page, charts, leaderboard, and category share all pick it up on the
next load. New genres go in the `CATS` map near the top of `index.html`'s script — a name and
a colour, one line.

## The rules this build enforces

Structural, not stylistic — wired into the code so they hold even as the dashboard grows.

- **Nothing is invented.** Every metric shows `No data yet` when the value is `null`. A failed
  pull writes `NULL`, never `0` and never last week's number carried forward.
- **Players and volume are never blended.** Two separate leaderboards, ranked independently —
  a single composite score would hide which one actually moved.
- **Reach and onchain are never merged.** A game's page visits and its onchain wallet count sit
  side by side, labelled, never summed into one figure.
- **Conversion needs consent.** `sg-track.js`'s `linkWallet()` drops client-side without
  `consent: true`, and the server returns 403 without it. Addresses are hashed with a server
  pepper before storage — the raw address is never written.
- **No sample data, ever.** There's no preview/demo mode. If a number isn't real, the dashboard
  says so instead of showing something plausible-looking.
- **Provenance is always on screen.** The header pill shows the data source and last-updated
  time on every page, and turns amber if the last pull is more than 9 days old.

## Known limits (also stated on the About page)

A unique wallet isn't a unique person — session keys and multi-wallet play inflate counts.
Volume depends on contract structure, so a game that batches calls looks smaller than one that
doesn't. Games with several contracts only count the ones registered here. Week boundaries are
UTC Monday.
