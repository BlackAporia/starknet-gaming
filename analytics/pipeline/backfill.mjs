 * backfill.mjs — one-off historical backfill
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Walks the games listed below back to their real first on-chain
 * activity and fills in every period between then and now — the same
 * upsert weekly-pull.mjs does, just run in a loop over history instead
 * of once for "today". Reuses pullPeriod() from pull-lib.mjs, so a
 * backfilled period and a freshly-pulled one are produced by the exact
 * same code path — nothing here is a special case that could drift.
 *
 * Excluded by default: ponziland, loot-survivor. Both are high-volume
 * enough (tens of thousands of tx/week) that a full-history backfill of
 * either is a genuinely separate job — run it on its own once you're
 * ready to sit with the rate limit for that long. Edit EXCLUDE below to
 * change the set.
 *
 * ── How it finds "launch" without guessing ─────────────────────────
 * No endpoint here hands you a contract's deployment date, and this
 * deliberately avoids assuming one from Starkscan's event ordering
 * (undocumented, and wrong if assumed wrong). Instead, for each
 * contract:
 *   1. hasActivityInRange(address, 0, block) is a 1-item existence
 *      check — costs one request no matter how much history is in that
 *      range — so binary-searching it over the block space finds the
 *      contract's first-ever activity block in ~20 requests, not one
 *      request per page of its whole history.
 *   2. That block number is converted back to an approximate date by
 *      binary-searching blockAtTimestamp() — the exact function
 *      weekly-pull.mjs already relies on — instead of guessing a new,
 *      unverified block→timestamp endpoint.
 * The earliest date found across every included game becomes the
 * global start. Some games will show real, honest 0-tx periods before
 * their own launch — that's correct, not a bug: the contract genuinely
 * had no activity yet, and 0 is what actually happened.
 *
 * ── Resumability ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Before pulling a period, it's skipped if every included game already
 * has a captured (non-NULL, non-"failed") row for it. Safe to Ctrl-C
 * and re-run — it picks up roughly where it left off instead of
 * re-spending the rate limit on periods already done.
 *
 * Run:  node backfill.mjs
 *       node backfill.mjs --budget=500     (cap new sender lookups per
 *                                            period — default: no cap,
 *                                            since a historical period
 *                                            never gets a second chance
 *                                            to finish resolving)
 *       node backfill.mjs --year=2026      (only backfill weeks within
 *                                            that calendar year — the
 *                                            per-game real launch date
 *                                            is still what's used for
 *                                            any game that launched
 *                                            *after* Jan 1 of that year;
 *                                            this only raises the floor,
 *                                            never lowers it below a
 *                                            game's real start)
 *       node backfill.mjs --budget=500 --year=2026   (combine both)
 *
 * This is a manual, local run — it is NOT wired into GitHub Actions.
 * It can take a while (rate-limited to ~1 Starkscan request/second);
 * let it run, don't parallelize it against the same API key.
